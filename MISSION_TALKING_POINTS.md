### The Problem (Educational Threads)
```
🧵 Why is silver still under $100?

Because the paper market controls the price, not supply and demand.

Let me explain... 1/
```

```
Every day, more "paper silver" trades on COMEX than the entire annual global silver production.

Think about that.

The price you see isn't based on real silver. It's based on contracts that never get delivered.

$SVCK community gets it. 🥈
```

```
The gold/silver ratio is currently ~53:1

Historically, it's been 15:1

Either gold is way overpriced, or silver is way underpriced.

We think you know the answer. 👑

### Community Building
```
$SVCK isn't about the token.

It's about the community of people who:
• Know silver is manipulated
• Stack physical
• Understand sound money
• Want to connect with others who get it

The token is just our badge. 🥈👑
```

```
Why did we create $SVCK?

Because silver stackers have been scattered across Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube for years.

We wanted ONE place where the community could gather.

That's it. That's the mission.

Meanwhile:

But sure, the price is "fair" 🙄

```

### Discussion Starters
```
📢 Discussion topic:

The COMEX trades 800M+ ounces of paper silver daily.

Global annual silver production is only ~800M ounces.

That means an entire year's production trades... every single day... on paper.
